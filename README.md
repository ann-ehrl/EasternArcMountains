# EasternArcMountains
This repository was created with the purpose of sharing Google Earth Engine code developed for land designation of the Eastern Arc Mountains. 
This code determines land cover within the region of interest and produes a raster of this information. 
It conducts an investigation every ten years during the rainy season with lush vegetation, selecting imagery with low cloud cover.
